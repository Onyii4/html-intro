      <h2>My Tech Journey</h2>
      <p>
        Just last year, if someone had told me I would be on a tech journey, I wouldâ€™ve laughed and walked away. I had zero interest, not even a little curiosity. ðŸ˜‚ But life had plans for me, and here I amâ€¦ fully in.
        <br><br>
        It all started with a 3-month free cybersecurity class organized by Multi Life Savers. I joined, unsure of what to expect, but I quickly fell in love with how powerful and eye-opening the tech space could be. That one decision opened so many doors.
        <br><br>
        Through the same Multi Life Savers organization, I got the chance of a lifetime, a scholarship from Genesys Tech Hub to study Web Development. I was in awe. Me? In tech? But yes, it was happening, and I embraced it wholeheartedly.
        <br><br>
        Along the way, I explored more. I joined HGSCsquare and dived into Digital Marketing and Community Management. I didnâ€™t just learn, I excelled. I emerged as the <strong>best student in Digital Marketing</strong>, and it gave me the confidence to keep going.
        <br><br>
        Now, Iâ€™m currently focused on the Genesys Web Development Scholarship. Iâ€™m a pure beginner... I mean, totally fresh ðŸ˜‚ but Iâ€™m learning. Iâ€™m showing up. And Iâ€™m doing my best every single day.
        <br><br>
        So yeah, this is me... Onyinyechukwu Prisca. Welcome to my tech world. Iâ€™m so glad I chose this path. It hasnâ€™t been easy, but itâ€™s been worth it. And this is only the beginning ðŸ’–
